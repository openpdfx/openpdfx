# Openpdfx-AI

**Openpdfx-AI** is an experimental module that brings artificial intelligence capabilities into 
openpdfx,
using the [Jlama](https://github.com/tjake/Jlama) Java-native LLM framework.

With Jlama, Openpdfx-AI can run modern AI models directly inside the JVM without external services.
