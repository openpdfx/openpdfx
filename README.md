## Background

version 5.0 of iText, the developers have moved to the AGPL to improve their ability to sell
commercial licenses.

OpenPDF-html is a fork of Flying Saucer, forked in june 2025, project started in 2004.
openpdf-renderer is a fork of PDFRenderer, porject started by Sun Labs in 2007.
OpenPDF-core is a fork of iText, forked in October 2016, iText started in 2000.
